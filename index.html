        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I made a game called PLS DONATE FAKE ðŸ’µ on Roblox, I'm kind of surprised at how fast it was getting popular. The game was only supposed to be a side project!</p>
        <p>When I started Roblox I was an Exploiter (I'm not anymore of course), I had nothing else to do lol, I started making some trash games like a troll obby, some time later I got bored of that, then I found that there are some uncopylockeds I can use, like PLS DONATE uncopylocked. I started experimenting on it, and fixed some bugs. After a while, I found some people to play my game, they liked it. After that not much happened and I just abandoned the game, while I was gone, the game spiked, and a lot of people were playing the game! I then started editing the game so people would find it more fun, when I did that, some people were begging for admin, I trusted them, so I gave it to them. After that, It started to go downhill, players were complaining about the players I ranked abusing, I had no choice but to remove HD admin from the game and add "Trusted CMDS". There are still some people currently complaining about who has more fake robux and who doesn't, I guess I should just reset all stats, shouldn't I?</p>
